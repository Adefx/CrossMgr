#
#    Checklist for CrossMgr.
#    
#    When CrossMgr starts, it checks for a "CrossMgrChecklist.txt" file in race folder,
#    then your home folder, then in the CrossMgrImages folder where CrossMgr was installed.
#    
#    To customize the checklist, copy the standard CrossMgrChecklist.txt file into your
#    home directory.
#
#    Alternatively, if you want a specific Checklist for a specific race, you can copy 
#    CrossMgrChecklist.txt into the same folder as the race.
#
#    Then, edit it from there.  This is a structured file - be careful!
#
#    VERY IMPORTANT:  DO NOT PUT TABS IN THE FILE.  ALL INDENTATION MUST BE IN SPACES.
#
#    A checklist task has the following structure:
#    
#    task
#        title = ...Title of the task shown in CrossMgr...
#        note = ...note.  notes can be multi-line as long as subsequent lines "line up" 
#               with the start of the line above it.  Make sure there is a "trailing space" at the end of 
#               the line - no space is inserted after the line break.
#        requires
#            ...Requirements for the task to be displayed.  Optional - see below...
#        subtasks
#            ...Subtasks of this checklist task.  Optional.  You can nest tasks and subtasks any level deep.
#
#    If all the conditions in the "requires" section are met, the task (and all its subtasks) will be shown, otherwise, it will not appear.
#    
#    Acceptable "requires" are:
#    
#        RaceStatus = NotStarted | Running | Finished    # The current status of the race.
#        TimeTrial = True | False                        # True if this is a TimeTrial.
#        Camera = True | False                           # True if the "Enable USB Camera" options is selected.
#        ChipReader = True | False                       # True if the "Enable JChip Integration" option is selected.
#        
#    Examples:
#    
#        requires
#            TimeTrial = True                            # Item will be shown if TimeTrial is True
#
#        requires                                        # Item will be shown if both RaceStatus = NotStarted
#            RaceStatus = NotStarted                     # And ChipReader = False
#            ChipReader = False                          # And Camera = False
#            Camera = False
#        
#    Requires conditions apply to all of the subtasks of a task.
