## New...
Creates a new race.  Opens the Property dialog to configure a new race.

## New Next...
Creates a new race based on an existing one.  New Next... will keep the same Name, Organizer, Commissaire and other properties and increment the race number.
After the new race is created, you just need to check the start time, duration and categories.
This feature allows you to create the next race in the day very quickly.

## Open...
Open an existing race.

## Open Next...
Open the next race based on the existing one.  CrossMgr will look for a race with the next race number in the same folder.

## Restore from Original Input...
Restores all entries for a race from the original entered data.  CrossMgr automatically creates a backup .csv file that it write all entries to.  If you make a lot of changes by accident, you can restore from the original data here.

Although not recommended, some advanced users have edited the .csv file manually, the "restored" from it.

## Recent Files
Keeps track of the last few files opened so then can be opened again quickly.

## Close Race
Closes the current race.  All changes are written to disk.  Clears CrossMgr.

## Exit
Stops CrossMgr.  If a race is running, the clock will continue to run in CrossMgr.  When reopened, the race will resume, even if reopened on another computer.
