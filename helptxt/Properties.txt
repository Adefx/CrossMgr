# Properties
Allows you to configure properties of the race itself.  Specific properties of each Category are defined in the Category screen.

# Property Screen

Property|Description
:-------|:----------
Race Name|Name of the race.  Also used in the filename.
Date|Date of the race.  Used in the filename and all output.
Race #|The number of the race in the day at the event.  Also used in the filename.  This is automatically incremented when you do "File/New Next..."
Scheduled Start|Scheduled start of the race.  This is used in the results output.  Of course, the race could actually start at a different time.
Race Minutes|The number of minutes in the race for timed races (like CycloCross).  When the "Race Laps" is set for all [Categories][] (that is, a lap-counted race), this is ignored.
Discipline|The type of race (default Cyclo-cross).  This should reflect the type of race (Road, Mountain Bike, Criterium, etc.).  Currently, this is only used in the [USAC Export][].
Organizer|Organizer of the race.  Included in the HTML results output.
Commissaire|The name of the race official.
Memo|Anything you wish to type in here (weather conditions, your mood, etc.)
Distance Unit|km or miles for the distances specified in Categories
Show Times to 100s of Second|You choice to display regular seconds or fractions of seconds in Results and History.  Also configurable from the Options menu.
Time Trial|Specifies Time Trial mode.  In this mode, the first time recorded for a rider starts the clock for that rider, rather than the start of the race.
Enable USB Camera Photo Finish|Takes a photo from a connected USB camera on every number entry.  See Notes below for details.
JChip Integration|Specifies that JChip integration is to be used in the race.  When set, CrossMgr will act as a "server" that can receive real-time messages from a JChip receiver.  See [JChip Setup](Menu-ChipReader.html#jchip-setup-dialog) for details.
Set "Autocorrect Lap Data" option by Default|If true, CrossMgr sets the Autocorrect option by default when a rider is added to the race.  See [RiderDetail](RiderDetail.html) for details about Autocorrect.  If false, the Autocorrect option will not be set when a rider is added to the race.  You can change the Autocorrect option by rider in RiderDetail.  You can also enable/disable Autocorrect for all riders at once with "Edit/Enable Autocorrect for All Riders" and "Edit/Disable Autocorrect for All Riders".
Animation Reverse Direction|Runs the animation from right-to-left (clockwise) instead of the usual left-to-right (counter-clockwise).  Also changes HTML output to match.
Animation Finish on Top|Tells the animation to finish on the top rather than on the bottom.  Also changes HTML ouput to match.
Excel Sheet|Externally Linked Excel Sheet name.
Categories Imported From|File name of the categories import file.  Of course, the Category properties can be changed afterwards.
File Name|File name generated for this race.

Notes:
## Time Trial Mode
Time Trial mode is a special mode that works much differently from the regular race mode.  In TT mode, the first read for a rider starts his/her clock, and subsequent reads are all taken with respect to the start time.

At this point, TT mode does not accept an externally seeded start list.  It simply starts a clock on the first entry for each rider.  TT mode works with manual input and JChip.  TT results are computed relative to the rider's ride time.

## Enable USB Camera Photo Finish
Windows Only.

This option tells CrossMgr to take a picture with a USB webcam every time a number is entered during the race.
In addition to making nice pictures of the event for publishing later, this feature is useful in resolving disputes.

CrossMgr automatically looks for a USB webcam plugged into a USB port.  If it does not find one there, and you have a built-in webcam, it might find the built-in one (not what you want!).  Make sure the USB camera is plugged in before starting the race.

Invest is a good USB camera.  Some good ones are available for about $100.  Make sure the camera can focus on far-away objects (some webcams are only intended for faces in front of a computer).  Use a tripod.  Use the camera's included software to frame the shot. 

Photos are saved in a folder created in the same location as the race.  The Photo folder has the same name as the race with with "_Photos" added to the end.  The photo files have the following format: "bib-XXXX-time-HH-MM-SS-DD.jpg" where XXXX is the bib number, HH, MM, SS and DD are hours, minutes, seconds, and decimal seconds, respectively.
A footer is written on each photo including the rider's Bib number, the Race Time and the Current Date/Time.

For performance reasons, CrossMgr opens a connection to the USB webcam at the start of the race and closes it at the end.  Do Not Disconnect the USB Camera during the race!  This may cause CrossMgr to freeze.  Of course, you can always close CrossMgr and restart it if this happens.

There are many considerations when setting up the camera to get good shots.  The first issue is timing.  There are always small delays in the communication and response of the camera.  If the camera is aimed at the finish line with a very narrow field of view, the riders may be out of the frame before the camera records the picture!

This is especially possible on fast finishes.  When using Chip timing, there are additional delays in the communication of the chip reader and CrossMgr.

To mitigate timing issues, it is recommended to configure the camera with a wider field of view and position it facing the riders.  With this angle, it will be less likely that the riders will go out of frame before the picture is captured.
Some USB cameras have an auto-focus feature that is fast enough to follow a moving subject.  However, some cameras cannot refocus fast enough and the riders will always appear blurry (turn it off in this case).  Check what works best for your camera.

The second issue is lighting and the position of the sun.  Aiming the camera into the sun will "blind" it, and the riders will appear all black.  Some experimentation will be required, and don't be surprised if you have to change the camera position throughout the day to compensate for the changing lighting conditions.  Periodically preview what the camera is seeing.

Chip timing creates other considerations.  When the chip reader "sees" a group of riders (say, 20), it sends all its information in one message to CrossMgr.  Instead of triggering the camera for all riders in the message, CrossMgr takes one picture, and uses the bib of the first rider in the group.  Riders in the same group will be captured in the same picture as best as possible.  This is the best it can do as the camera cannot be triggered fast enough to capture all riders in the group.

## Question: When is a Rider in the Race?
CrossMgr considers a rider in the race if (a) there is a time entry for the rider or (b) the rider Status (DNS, DQ, etc.) is set.  It does not automatically add all riders described in the Excel sheet.
