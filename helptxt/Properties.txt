# Properties
Allows you to configure properties of the race itself.  Specific properties of each Category are defined in the Category screen.

# Property Screen

Property|Description
:-------|:----------
Event Name|Name of the event.  Also used in the filename with the Race #.  Multiple races in the day will have the same Event Name, but with different race numbers.
Date|Date of the race.  Used in the filename and all output.
Race #|The number of the race in the day at the event.  Also used in the filename.  This is automatically incremented when you do "File/New Next..."
Scheduled Start|Scheduled start of the race.  This is used in the results output.  Of course, the race could actually start at a different time.
Race Minutes|The number of minutes in the race for timed races (like CycloCross).  When the "Race Laps" is set for all [Categories][] (that is, a lap-counted race), this is ignored.
Discipline|The type of race (default Cyclo-cross).  This should reflect the type of race (Road, Mountain Bike, Criterium, etc.).  Currently, this is only used in the [USAC Export][].
Organizer|Organizer of the race.  Included in the HTML results output.
Commissaire|The name of the race official.
Memo|Anything you wish to type in here (weather conditions, your mood, etc.).  This is only saved with the race and does not appear on any output.
Distance Unit|km or miles for the distances specified in Categories
Show Times to 100s of Second|You choice to display regular seconds or fractions of seconds in Results and History.  Also configurable from the Options menu.
All Categories Finish After Fastest Rider's Last Lap|Applies to multi-category races only.  Tells CrossMgr that all riders were stopped after the fastest rider in the race finished.  This means you stopped riders lapped by the fastest Category leader, but not lapped by their own Category leader.  This option is ignored for all Categories with "Race Laps" specified (see [Categories][]).
Time Trial|Specifies Time Trial mode.  In this mode, the first time recorded for a rider starts the clock for that rider, rather than the start of the race.  See [Notes](#time-trial-mode).
Use USB Camera for Photo Finish|Takes a photo from a connected USB camera on every number entry.  See [Notes](#use-usb-camera-photo-finish) below for details.  Currently, the USB Camera option is only available on the Windows platform.
Use RFID Reader|Use an RFID reader in the race.  When set, CrossMgr will act as a "server" that can receive real-time messages from a RFID reader.  The reader can be JChip, or the CrossMgrImpinj or CrossMgrAlien bridge programs that communicate with the Impinj and Alien readers, respectively.  See [RFID Reader Setup](Menu-ChipReader.html#rfid-reader-setup-dialog) for details.
Set "Autocorrect Lap Data" option by Default|If true, CrossMgr sets the Autocorrect option by default when a rider is added to the race.  See [RiderDetail](RiderDetail.html) for details about Autocorrect.  If false, the Autocorrect option will not be set when a rider is added to the race.  You can change the Autocorrect option by rider in RiderDetail.  You can also enable/disable Autocorrect for all riders at once with "Edit/Enable Autocorrect for All Riders" and "Edit/Disable Autocorrect for All Riders".
Animation Finish on Top|Tells the animation to finish on the top rather than on the bottom.  Also changes HTML ouput to match.
Animation Reverse Direction|Runs the animation from right-to-left (clockwise) instead of the usual left-to-right (counter-clockwise).  Also changes HTML output to match.
Notes|Text that will appear in the HTML output.  Text entered here will be shown as-is in the HTML web page, including line breaks.  Describe weather conditions, or give credit to the CrossMgr operator and number caller.  You can also use Html tags, however, your input must then start with <html> and end with </html>.  With Html tags, you can specify a hyperlink to a URL with <a href="http://XXX">HyperLink</a>, use a list with <ol></ol>, etc.  When using Html, you control line breaks; <br/>'s will not be automatically inserted between newlines.
Excel Sheet|Externally Linked Excel Sheet name.
Categories Imported From|File name of the categories import file.  Of course, the Category properties can be changed afterwards.
File Name|File name generated for this race.

Notes:
## Time Trial Mode
Time Trial mode is a special mode that works differently from the regular race mode.  In TT mode, the first read for a rider starts his/her clock, and subsequent reads are all taken with respect to the rider's start time.

TT start times can also be imported into CrossMgr from an Excel spreadsheet (see [Menu-DataMgmt.html][] for details).  This spreadsheet simply requires a header row with at least two columns: the Bib number, and the Start Time.

Otherwise, the first input for a rider is taken as his/her start time.

TT mode works with manual input and JChip.  TT results are computed relative to the rider's ride time.

TT penalties and/or adjustments can be made afterwards.  You can add a note to describe what you did.  See the "Note..." feature in [Chart Right-Click][].

## Use USB Camera for Photo Finish
Currently Windows Only.

This option tells CrossMgr to take a picture with a USB webcam every time it gets a number during the race.
It works with a chip reader, as well as manual input.
In addition to making nice pictures of the event for publishing later, this feature is useful in resolving disputes.

CrossMgr automatically looks for a USB webcam plugged into a USB port.  If it does not find one there, and you have a built-in webcam, it might find the built-in one (not what you want!).  Make sure the USB camera is plugged in and working before starting the race.

The USB camera feature can be turned on and off during the race at any time.  You can turn it on at the start, off in the middle, then on again to capture the last laps and the finish.

Photos are saved in a folder created in the same location as the race.  The Photo folder has the same name as the race with with "_Photos" added to the end.  The photo files have the following format: "bib-XXXX-time-HH-MM-SS-DD.jpg" where XXXX is the bib number, HH, MM, SS and DD are hours, minutes, seconds, and decimal seconds, respectively.
A footer is written on each photo including the rider's Bib number, the Race Time and the Current Date/Time.

Although the pictures taken are far smaller than recording the entire video on disk, they can still take a lot of space.  Make sure you have lots of disk space available to accomodate the potential 500 (or more!) pictures that might be taken.

Get a good USB camera.  Some good ones are available for about $100.  Make sure the camera can focus on far-away objects (some webcams are only intended for faces in front of a computer).  Use a tripod or other stable support.  Use the camera's included software to frame the shot. 

For performance reasons, CrossMgr opens a connection to the USB webcam at the start of the race and closes it at the end.  Do Not Disconnect the USB Camera during the race!  This may cause CrossMgr to lock up.  Of course, you can always close CrossMgr and restart it if this happens.

There are many considerations when setting up the camera to get good shots.  The first issue to consider is "latency".  There are always small delays in the communication and response of the camera.  If the camera is aimed at the finish line with a very narrow field of view, the riders may be out of the frame before the camera gets the signal to take the picture.

When using Chip timing, CrossMgr triggers the camera as fast as possible after receiving the tag read message from the reader - even before updating the screen.  With manual timing, CrossMgr triggers the camera as soon as it logs the entry and before it updates the screen.  However, neither of these processes are instananeous.

To mitigate timing issues, it is recommended to configure the camera with a wider field of view and position it more facing the riders (or looking backwards if you need to see the numbers).  With this angle, it will be less likely that the riders will go out of frame before the camera is triggered.
Some USB cameras have an auto-focus feature that is fast enough to follow a moving subject.  However, some cameras cannot refocus fast enough and the riders will always appear blurry (turn it off in this case).  Check what works best.

The second issue is lighting.  Aiming the camera into the sun will "blind" it, and the riders will appear as dark blotches on a white background.  Some experimentation will be required, and don't be surprised if you have to change the camera position throughout the day to compensate for changing lighting conditions.  Periodically review what the camera is seeing.

Chip timing creates other considerations.  When the chip reader "sees" a group of riders (say, 20), it may send all its information in one message to CrossMgr.  Instead of triggering the camera for all riders in the message, CrossMgr takes one picture, and uses the bib of the first rider in the group.  In this way, riders in the same group will be captured with one picture.  At 30 frames per second (the frame rate of a typical video camera), the camera cannot respond fast enough to capture all riders in a large group anyway.

To prevent locking up, CrossMgr will never take more than 10 pictures per second.

## Question: When is a Rider in the Race?
CrossMgr considers a rider in the race if (a) there is a time entry for the rider or (b) the rider Status (DNS, DQ, etc.) is set.  It does not automatically add all riders described in the Excel sheet.
