# Property Screen

Property|Description
:-------|:----------
Race Name|Name of the race.  Also used in the filename.
Organizer|Organizer of the race.  Included in the HTML results output.
Date|Date of the race.  Used in the filename and all output.
Race #|The number of the race in the day at the event.  Also used in the filename.
Scheduled Start|Scheduled start of the race.  This is used in the results output.  Of course, the race could actually start at a different time.
Race Minutes|The number of minutes in the race for timed races (like CycloCross).  For lap counted races, this is not as important.
Memo|Anything you wish to type in here (weather conditions, your mood, etc.)
Commissaire|The name of the race official
Time Trial|Specifies Time Trial mode.  In this mode, the first time recorded for a rider starts the clock for that rider, rather than the start of the race.
JChip Integration|Specifies that JChip integration is to be used in the race.  When set, CrossMgr will act as a "server" that can receive real-time messages from a JChip receiver.  See [JChip Setup](Menu-ChipReader.html#jchip-setup-dialog) for details.
Set "Autocorrect Lap Data" option by Default|If true, CrossMgr sets the Autocorrect option by default when a rider is added to the race.  See [RiderDetail](RiderDetail.html) for details about Autocorrect.  If false, the Autocorrect option will not be set when a rider is added to the race.  You can change the Autocorrect option by rider in RiderDetail.  You can also enable/disable Autocorrect for all riders at once with "Edit/Enable Autocorrect for All Riders" and "Edit/Disable Autocorrect for All Riders".
Show Times to 100s of Second|You choice to display regular seconds or fractions of seconds in Results and History.  Also configurable from the Options menu.
Distance Unit|km or miles for the distances specified in Categories
Animation Reverse Direction|Runs the animation from right-to-left (clockwise) instead of the usual left-to-right (counter-clockwise).  Also changes HTML output to match.
Animation Finish on Top|Tells the animation to finish on the top rather than on the bottom.  Also changes HTML ouput to match.
Excel Sheet|Externally Linked Excel Sheet name.
Categories Imported From|File name of the categories import file.  Of course, the Category properties can be changed afterwards.
File Name|File name generated for this race.

Notes:
## Time Trial Mode
Time Trial mode is a special mode that works much differently from the regular race mode.  In TT mode, the first read for a rider starts his/her clock, and subsequent reads are all taken with respect to the start time.

At this point, TT mode does not accept an externally seeded start list.  It simply starts a clock on the first entry for each rider.  TT mode works with manual input and JChip.  TT results are computed relative to the rider's ride time.

## Question: When is a Rider in the Race?
CrossMgr considers a rider in the race if (a) there is a time entry for the rider or (b) the rider Status (DNS, DQ, etc.) is set.  It does not automatically add all riders described in the Excel sheet.
