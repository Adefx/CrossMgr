## Introduction

Riders and spectators appreciate live results at the race - it creates a richer experience for the participants and creates a more professional impression for you.

CrossMgr makes it __extremely__ easy to publish real-time results at race on a local wireless network.
CrossMgr itself acts like a web server and serves up real-time content from its race data.

This feature is in great contrast to "the bad old days" of on-site real-time results where you would need to install and configure a web server, an ftp server, and configure the FTP publish from CrossMgr.

Of course, FTP publish is still available in CrossMgr (see ([DataMgmt][] for details) and is great for publishing to a public web site.

For on-site results - especially where there is no access to public internet, the built-in Web feature is far more practical. Especially for busy timers who have more important things to worry about (like getting accurate results).

### Step 1:
__Make sure the CrossMgr computer is connected to a Wifi Network.__

1. The Wifi does not have to be connected to the external internet.  It is better if it isn't as members of the public will be connecting to it to get the race results on site.
1. Make sure the Wifi is __not__ password protected.  Riders and spectators need to connect to it.
1. If you are not using a chip reader, you can just connect the CrossMgr computer to a local wireless network produce from a wireless router.
1. If you are using a chip reader with CrossMgr, use a cable plugged into a wireless router to connect the CrossMgr computer to the chip reader.

### Step 2:
__Publish and Share the Page with Race Attendees__

1. Routers support access through the computer's name.  For example, if your computer is named "results-local", you can access the CrossMgr page with  __http://results-local:8765__.  You may wish to rename you computer to something web-friendly that makes sense.
1. CrossMgr makes sharing the results page easy.  On the __Index Page__ (see below), click on the __Share__ link.
1. Print out, or otherwise share the QR Code with race attendees and participants.  Participants connect to your local Wifi network, then using their QR Code app, they can instantly connect to the live results.  Alternatively, they can type in the url listed on the page.
1. Once connected, participants can easily share their connected by clickong in the __Share__ link right on the page.  This shows the QR Code page which makes it easy for other participants to get access to the page.

That's it!

## Time Trials and the TTStart page.

For Time Trials, the TTStart countdown page is available from the Index page.  Just click on the stopwatch icon next to the race name.
This allows the starting official, wip, coaches, spectators and anyone else to see the start countdown in real-time.

Of course, accessing the results of a time trial will also show the start times.

### Tutorial 1
You can try this out for yourself.  For this experiment, you will need a CrossMgr computer and a tablet on the same wireless network.

1. Start CrossMgr
1. Do __Tools|Sumulate Race...__ to start the race simulation.
1. Do __Web|Index Page...__ to show the index page.  This is live connected to the CrossMgr program.
1. From the Index page, click on the __Share__ link at the top.  This brings up a __QR Code__ for the page.
1. With a tablet on the same wireless network of the CrossMgr computer, launch the QR Code app and point it at the CrossMgr computer screen.  Follow the link on the tablet read from the QR cCode.
1. The tablet will now show the Index page.  Notice that the tablet also has access to the __Share__ link.  This allows other people to share the link to the race results.
1. If this does not work, you may have to open port 8765 on your computer.  Check the instructions for how to do for your operating system.
1. On the tablet, click on the __Simulation__ race.  The tablet now shows the live results of the race.  Clicking on the logo at the top of the screen will refresh the page.  The page will also refresh automatically after each leader's lap.
1. All races in the same folder will be shown in the Index page - not just the race that is running.  If you have used CrossMgr previously and have a number of races with published html in the same folder, try opening one of the races and refreshing the Index page.

Races in progress are highlighted on the Index page.

### Notes:
__Remember:__ live results are a direct connection between your CrossMgr race and the web.  All changes you make will be immediately visible.  Use caution.

__Multiple versions of CrossMgr open at the same time:__  The first one open will act as the web server.  If the first on is closed, another will take over after a few seconds.

## Index Page
Opens a browser showing the CrossMgr web index page.

The current race is connectd to real-time CrossMgr data.
Other races in the same folder 

## QR Code Share Page
Opens a browser and loads the CrossMgr web QR Code Share page.

Publish this to allow people to connect to real-time results.
Print this out and post it at the race.  This will allow people to easily access the real-time results.
