# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## I have Lapped Riders.  Why doesn't CrossMgr show their last lap?

CrossMgr assumes that all riders finish on the leader's last lap.  If rider complete fewer laps in the race than the leader, they are ranked by laps completed, then by finish time.

If you are not pulling riders who have been lapped, and you want them to finish the race, select the __Lapped Riders Continue__ option in [Categories][].

This tells CrossMgr to expect that all riders will do the full distance and not to score the rides as if they finished on the leader's lap.
