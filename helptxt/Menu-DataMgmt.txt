## Link to External Excel Data...
Link to an external Excel file containing additional rider data.

This option opens up a Wizard to configure a link to an Excel sheet:

1. Choose the Excel workbook containing your additional data.
1. Choose the sheet within the Excel sheet.
1. Choose how the internal CrossMgr fields map to the Excel column names.  The Excel sheet may contain more fields than CrossMgr uses, and the column names in the sheet do not have to be the same as CrossMgr's names.  You just have to tell CrossMgr what Excel columns correspond to its fields.  CrossMgr can usually use the same Excel sheet used as the rider sign-on sheet.
1. After the configuration, CrossMgr will show how many records it was able to read from the Excel workbook.
1. The additional external information will now be shown throughout CrossMgr.

This option creates a link to the Excel sheet - it does not store the Excel data inside CrossMgr.  If data in the Excel sheet changes at any time (before, during or after the race), CrossMgr will automatically pick up the changes and display them the next time the screen is refreshed (for example, after switching between screens).

This allows you to start a race without the full details entered into Excel, or without an Excel sheet entirely.  As the race is underway, you can update the details.

However, if you move the the Excel file, you will have to update the link to tell CrossMgr where to find the new location.

CrossMgr supports the following fields from an external Excel sheet:

Field|Description
-----|-----------
Bib#|Required.  Rider's bib number in the race.  Bib numbers should be allocated in logical number ranges if there are multiple categories in the race (for example, 1-99 = one category, 100-199 = another category, etc.)
LastName|Optional.  Rider's last name.  CrossMgr will automatically capitalize the last name.
FirstName|Optional.  Rider's first name.
Team|Optional.  Rider's team.
License|Optional.  Rider' license.  This can be the UCI code, a national code, or a regional code.  CrossMgr uses this for display only.
Category|Optional.  Rider's category.  This does not have to be the same as the race category.
Tag|Optional for manual input, required for chip input.  Rider's chip tag.
Tag2|Optional.  Rider's alternate chip tag for second bike.

To save space, CrossMgr may combine the first and last names into one field as "LASTNAME, Firstname".  In the scoreboard, it uses a further shorthand of "LASTNAME, F" where "F" is the first letter of the first name.


## Category Mgmt
### Import Categories from File...
Read the categories from a previously exported Categories file.

### Export Categories to File...
Export the currently defined categories to a file.  This is useful is you find yourself configuring the same categories many times and wish to reuse the same category definitions from one race to another.

### Export History to Excel...
Export the History data to Excel.  This is useful for manual review.

### Export Raw Data as HTML...
Export the raw data of the race into an HTML file.  This is useful for checking input received from a chip timing system, or manual input.
Edited entries are also shown with edit details, however, any missing entries projected by CrossMgr are not included.

Columns in the table are as follows:

Column|Description
------|-----------
Sequence Number|Number of the entry
Clock Time|Clock time of the entry
Race Time|Race time of the entry (= Clock Time - Race Start Time)
Bib#|Bib number of the rider
Race Cat.|Race category of the rider, if found
Name|"LAST, First" name of the rider (if present in the external Excel sheet)
Team|Team of the rider (if present in the external Excel sheet)
Category|Category of the rider (if present in the external Excel sheet)
License|License of the rider (if present in the external Excel sheet)
Tag|Chip tag associated with the entry (if chip timing and if present in the external Excel sheet)
Tag2|2nd chip tag associated with the entry (if chip timing and if present in the external Excel sheet)
