# Controls

## Start/Finish Race
Press this button to start the race.

When the race is running, press this button to finith the race.

Stopping the race turns off the ability to enter values through the [Record][] screen.  It is always possible to make manually edits at any time, or to add additional lap times in RiderDetail.

## Start Race Automatically at Future Time
Allows you to start the race automatically at a future time.  After setting the time, a display counts down to the race start.  You can Cancel the automatic start at any time.

## Chip Timing Options

### Record Every Tag Individually
This option records tags the same as if you entered them manually.  Every tag that is read will be recorded.

### Reset Start Clock on First Tag Read
After the race is started with the Start button, this option resets the race clock to zero on the first tag read.
It also ignores the first tag read for all riders.
After this initialization process which starts the race clock, every tag read will be recorded.

This idea behind this feature is that the riders are stages behind the start line.
After the whistle, the first rider over the line "starts" the race.  All tags are recorded after that.

### Skip First Tag Read for All Riders
After the race is started with the Start button, this option ignores the first tag read for all riders.

The idea behind this feature is that the riders are staged in a start area behind the finish line (say, 200m).  When the race starts, the riders pass the finish line - and the reader antennas.  You do not want to register this tag read as it "does not count".

When using this feature, be sure to set the "First Lap Distance" in [Categories][] to compensate for the run-up distance.  This will ensure that the riders speeds are computed correctly.

# Checklist

A task checklist.  The checklist helps you keep track of important steps in the timing process.  It does not change the functionality of CrossMgr in any way.

To change a task's status, right-click, or double-click on the task's name.

Only subtasks can be checked - parent tasks will automatically be checked off when all subtasks are complete.
