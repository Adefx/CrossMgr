## Start/Finish Race
Press this button to start the race.

When the race is running, press this button stop the race.

Stopping the race turns off the ability to enter values through the [Record](Record.html) screen.  It is always possible to make manually edits at any time.

## Reset Start Clock on First Tag Read
This option only applies to JChip.  After the race is started with the Start button, this option resets the race clock to zero on the first tag read.
It will also ignore the first tag read for all riders.

This idea behind this feature is that the riders are stages behind the start line.
After the whistle, the first rider over the line "starts" the race.

## Start Race Automatically at Future Time
Allows you to start the race automatically at a future time.  After setting the time, a display counts down to the race start.  You can Cancel the automatic start at any time.
