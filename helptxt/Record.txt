# Record
The Record screen allows you to manual enter numbers.
It also support a number of real-time displays showing important details about the course.

# Screen
The screen is roughly divided into four parts:

1. [Number Entry](#number-entry)
1. [Race Information](#race-information)
1. [Riders on Course](#riders-on-course)
1. [Race Lap Chart](#race-lap-chart)

## Number Entry

This consists of an edit area.

You can enter data through the regular keyboard or an external numeric keypad.  If you have a touchscreen, you can also enter data by pressing the on-screen buttons.

Experience has shown that using a touch-screen is a slower and less accurate method.  Additionally, touch screens tend not to work well in cold weather.  Use a keyboard or external keypad whenever possible.

Enter automatically enters the number and gives it a time.  The most accurate way to enter numbers is to type in the number when you hear the number caller, then press Enter just when the rider crosses the line.

You can also enter multiple numbers separated by commas on the same line.  When you press enter, all these numbers be entered with exactly the same time.  This is useful for starting a team in a team time trial all with the same time. 

After the first lap of a race you can click on a number in the [Expected](MainScreen.html#expected) window to enter it, rather than typing it in again.

There are a number of additional buttons:

Button|Description
:-----|:----------
DNF|Enter the rider as a DNF, and uses the current time as the DNF time.
Pull|Enters the rider as PUL, and uses the current time as the PUL time.
DQ|Enters the rider as DQ, and uses the current time as the DQ time.
