# Record
The Record screen allows you to manual enter numbers.
It also support a number of real-time displays showing important details about the course.

# Screen
The screen is roughly divided into four parts:

1. [Number Entry](#number-entry)
1. [Race Information](#race-information)
1. [Riders on Course](#riders-on-course)
1. [Race Lap Chart](#race-lap-chart)

## Number Entry

This is the section of the screen where data is entered manually.  Number and times entered with chip timing come into CrossMgr directly.

CrossMgr offers two "modes" to manually enter data: "Keypad" and "Time Trial"
The different modes are switched by a pressing button at the top left of the screen which either shows a Keypad or a Stopwatch, depending on the mode you will switch to.

In Keypad mode, the number is timestamped when you press Enter.

In Time Trial mode, you can get accurate times first, then add the bib numbers afterwards.

Each approach has pros and cons, and you can switch modes at any time.  Generally speaking you will use the modes for:

Race Format|Input Mode
:----------|:---------
Cyclo Cross|Keypad
MTB|Keypad
Road|Keypad
Time Trial|Time Trial
Downhill|Time Trial

### Keypad Number Entry Mode

When you enter a number in this mode, the number is "timestamped" when you press "Enter".  This is the standard input mode for Road, Cyclo Cross and MTB races when you have number caller, and riders arrive in quick succession for laps.

When you hear the number caller, you type in the number and press Enter.
After the first lap of a race, CrossMgr will predict the arrival of each rider in the [Expected](MainScreen.html#expected) window.  To enter the number again, you can just click on it rather than typing it in.

Entering a number also triggers the [USB Webcam][].

You can enter data through the regular keyboard or an external numeric keypad.  If you have a touchscreen, you can also enter data by pressing the on-screen buttons.

Experience has shown that using a touch-screen is a slower and less accurate method.  Additionally, touch screens tend not to work well in cold weather.  Use a keyboard or external keypad whenever possible.

Enter automatically enters the number and gives it a time.  The most accurate way to enter numbers is to type in the number when you hear the number caller, then press Enter just when the rider crosses the line.

You can also enter multiple numbers separated by commas on the same line.  When you press enter, all these numbers be entered with exactly the same time.  This is useful for starting a team in a team time trial all with exactly the same start time. 

There are a number of additional buttons:

Button|Description
:-----|:----------
DNF|Enter the rider as a DNF, and uses the current time as the DNF time.
Pull|Enters the rider as PUL, and uses the current time as the PUL time.
DQ|Enters the rider as DQ, and uses the current time as the DQ time.

### Time Trial Entry Mode

This is the standard input mode for time trial finishes.  It follows a similar process to a manual stopwatch, except you use the computer.

In time trial mode, you get times as the riders pass by pressing the "Tap for Time" button (similar to using a recording stopwatch).  This also triggers the [USB Webcam][] to take a picture, if enabled.

You then enter the numbers next to the times (you many not be able to see the number on the back of the rider until he/she has passed).

When you have entered all the corresponding bib numbers for the times, press the "Save" button.  This saves the input and clears the display for the next arrivals.

CrossMgr gives you 12 entries before a Save is required.  In practice, you should never see more than 3-4 riders crossing the finish without a gap, so 12 entries is a large number to work with.  If you see large groups of riders finishing together, they are drafting, which is not permitted.

Rather than taking your hands off the keyboard to use the mouse, use keyboard shortcuts:

Shortcut Key|Description
:-------|:----------
t|Record a Time.  Equivalent to pressing the "Tap for Time" button.
c|Commit the current entries.  Equivalent to pressing the "Save" button.

This allows you to do data entery quickly and accurately - without taking your hands off the keyboard.

Warning: The Time Trial input mode works well when there are start gaps between the riders.  If you have a timed mass single-start event, you may need Keypad mode, or alternatively, consider a [ChipReader][].

## Race Information

CrossMgr shows a lot of information about the race, especially while it is running:

Field|Description
:----|:----------
Race Time|The time since the race started.
Manual/Automatic Laps|For timed races, indicates whether the total laps should be computed automatically, or manually
Total Laps|For timed races, indicates the number of laps of the fastest category on course.  If the previous field is Manual, you can set the number of lap here yourself.
Est. Leader Time|Projected leader race time.  This only works if Autocorrect is enabled for all riders.
Est. Last Rider Time|Projected time of the last rider to finish.  This only works if Autocorrect is enabled for all riders.
Ave Lap Time|Average lap time of the leader.
Completing Lap|Lap current being completed
Show Laps to Go|Number of laps to go to be shown on the Lap Counter
Start Time|Start time of the race, and whether it was started manually or with the first chip read.
Est. Leader Finish|Projected clock time of the leader's finish time.  This only works if Autocorrect is enabled for all riders.  Disabled in time trial mode.
Est. Last Rider Finish|Projected clock time of the last rider to finish.  This only works if Autocorrect is enabled Clock|The current time of day.  Disabled in time trial mode.
Photo Count and Camera Button|Shows the photo count and camera button if the [USB Webcam][] is enabled.  Pressing the camera button brings up the last picture taken in the race.

## Riders on Course

This display shows the total riders on course, a breakdown of the riders by category, and a count of which riders are on each lap.

## Race Lap Chart

Shown after the 2nd lap, this display shows graphically, by Category:

* the total number of laps in the race, and the laps to go
* the Category leader's number
* a Progress bar as showing where the leader is in the race
* a Timer counting down to when the leader is next expected
* the projected Finish Time of the race (finish line flag)
* the projected Expected Time of the last rider on course (broom)
