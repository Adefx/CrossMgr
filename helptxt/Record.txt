# Record
The Record screen allows you to manual enter numbers.
It also support a number of real-time displays showing important details about the course.

# Screen
The screen is roughly divided into four parts:

1. [Number Entry](#number-entry)
1. [Race Information](#race-information)
1. [Riders on Course](#riders-on-course)
1. [Race Lap Chart](#race-lap-chart)

## Number Entry

This consists of an edit area with a numeric keypad underneath it.
Of course, you can enter data through the regular keyboard or a keypad.  Pressing the "Enter" key does exactly the same thing as pressing the Enter button.  Using a keyboard/keypad is the fastest and most accurate way to enter data.

The numeric keypad display is designed for use with touch screens or tablets.
Experience has shown that this is a slower and less accurate method.  Additionally, touch screens tend not to work well in cold weather.  Use a keyboard or keypad whenever possible.

Enter automatically enters the number and gives it a time.  The most accurate way to enter numbers is to type in the number when you hear the number caller, then press Enter just when the rider crosses the line.

Of course, after the first lap of a race you will likely be able to click on the numbers in the [Expected](MainScreen.html#expected) window rather than having to type it in again.

There are a number of additional buttons:

Button|Description
:-----|:----------
DNF|Enter the rider as a DNF, and uses the current time as the DNF time.
Pull|Enters the rider as PUL, and uses the current time as the PUL time.
DQ|Enters the rider as DQ, and uses the current time as the DQ time.

## Race Information

CrossMgr shows many fields about the race, especially while it is running:

This display shows the total riders on course, a breakdown of the riders by category, and a count of which riders are on each lap.

## Race Lap Chart

Shown after the 2nd lap, this display shows graphically:

* the total number of laps in the race, and the laps to go
* the race leader's number
* a progress bar as showing where the leader is in the race
