# Record
The Record screen allows you to manual enter numbers.
It also support a number of real-time displays showing important details about the course.

# Screen
The screen is roughly divided into four parts:

1. [Number Entry](#number-entry)
1. [Race Information](#race-information)
1. [Riders on Course](#riders-on-course)
1. [Race Lap Chart](#race-lap-chart)

## Number Entry

This is the section of the screen where data is entered manually.  Number and times entered with chip timing come into CrossMgr directly.

CrossMgr offers two "modes" to manually enter data: __Keypad__ and __Time Trial__.
The different modes are switched by a pressing button at the top left of the screen which either shows a Keypad or a Stopwatch, depending on the mode you will switch to.

In Keypad mode, the number is timestamped when you press Enter.

In Time Trial mode, you can get accurate times first, then add the bib numbers afterwards.

Each approach has pros and cons, and you can switch modes at any time.  Generally speaking you will use the modes for:

Race Format|Input Mode
:----------|:---------
Cyclo Cross|Keypad
MTB|Keypad
Road|Keypad
Time Trial|Time Trial
Downhill|Time Trial

### Keypad Number Entry Mode

When you enter a number in this mode, the number is "timestamped" when you press __Enter__.  This is the standard input mode for Road, Cyclo Cross and MTB races when you have number caller, and riders arrive in quick succession for laps.

When you hear the number caller, you type in the number and press Enter.
After the first lap of a race, CrossMgr will predict the arrival of each rider in the [Expected](MainScreen.html#expected) window.  To enter the number again, you can just click on it rather than typing it in.

Entering a number also triggers the [USB Webcam][].

You can enter data through the regular keyboard or an external numeric keypad.  If you have a touchscreen, you can also enter data by pressing the on-screen buttons.

Experience has shown that using a touch-screen is a slower and less accurate method.  Additionally, touch screens tend not to work well in cold weather.  Use a keyboard or external keypad whenever possible.

Enter automatically enters the number and gives it a time.  The most accurate way to enter numbers is to type in the number when you hear the number caller, then press Enter just when the rider crosses the line.

You can also enter multiple numbers separated by commas on the same line.  When you press enter, all these numbers be entered with exactly the same time.  This is useful for starting a team in a team time trial all with exactly the same start time. 

There are a number of additional buttons:

Button|Description
:-----|:----------
DNF|Enter the rider as a DNF, and uses the current time as the DNF time.
DNS|Enter the rider as a DNS.
Pull|Enters the rider as PUL, and uses the current time as the PUL time.
DQ|Enters the rider as DQ, and uses the current time as the DQ time.

Remember: if you change any rider's status here, you can always change it again from the [RiderDetail][] screen.

### Time Trial Entry Mode

This is the standard input mode for time trial finishes.  It follows a similar process to a manual stopwatch, except you use the computer.

In time trial mode, you get times as the riders pass by pressing the __Tap for Time__ button (similar to using a recording stopwatch).  This also triggers the [USB Webcam][] to take a picture, if enabled.

Rather then using the mouse, pressing the 't' key is a shortcut to __Tap for Time__.

You then enter the Bib numbers next to the times - you many not be able to see the number on the back of the rider until he/she has passed.

When you have entered the corresponding bib numbers for the times, press the __Save__ button.  This saves the input and clears the display for the next arrival(s).

Rather than using the mouse, pressing the 's' key is a shortcut to __Save__.

Press __Save__ as soon as you can!  This records the riders in CrossMgr.
Normally, you would __Tap for Time__ once, then enter the Bib for that time, then press __Save__.  One entry at a time.

Almost always, you see one rider at a time pressing __Save__ each time.

Sometimes, 3-4 riders will bunch up at the finish.  In this case, press __Tap for Time__ for each each rider, enter the Bib for each rider, then press __Save__.

CrossMgr gives you up to 12 entries before you must press Save.  This is a large number to work with!  If you see large groups of riders finishing together, they are drafting, which is not permitted.

If you cannot read a rider's number, and can't find it within 12 riders, enter an invalid, but unique temporary Bib number for the rider, say 8000.
After the race you can correct the number.  This is an exceptional process.

Finally, remember that with keyboard shortcuts, you can operate in TT mode without using the mouse.  This is much more convenient and accurate:

Shortcut Key|Description
:-------|:----------
t|Equivalent to pressing the __Tap for Time__ button.
s|SEquivalent to pressing the __Save__ button.

The keyboard shortcuts are quicker and more accurate.

Warning: The Time Trial input mode only works when there are start gaps between the riders.  If you have a timed mass single-start event, you may need Keypad mode, or alternatively, consider a [ChipReader][].

## Race Information

This view is especially useful if you are managing a multi-category race with one lap counter for the fastest category.
If you want to run a multi-category race with separate lap counters, use the [Race Lap Chart](#race-lap-chart) described below which shows the race progress graphically.

Field|Description
:----|:----------
Race Time|The time since the race started.
Max Laps|Indicates the number of laps of the fastest category on course.  If the "Race Laps" field for a Category is empty, its laps will be computed from the Race Minutes, otherwise, the "Race Laps" field will be used for the laps for that category.
Est. Leader Time|Projected leader race time of the fastest category on course.  This only works if Autocorrect is enabled for all riders.
Est. Last Rider Time|Projected time of the last rider to finish for all categories.  This only works if Autocorrect is enabled for all riders.
Ave Lap Time|Average lap time of the leader for the fastest category.
Completing Lap|Lap current being completed for the fastest category.
Show Laps to Go|Number of laps to go for the fastest category (to be shown on the Lap Counter).
Start Time|Start time of the race, and whether it was started manually or with the first chip read.
Est. Leader Finish|Projected clock time of the leader's finish time.  This only works if Autocorrect is enabled for all riders.  Disabled in time trial mode.
Est. Last Rider Finish|Projected clock time of the last rider to finish.  This only works if Autocorrect is enabled Clock|The current time of day.  Disabled in time trial mode.
Photo Count and Camera Button|Shows the photo count and camera button if the [USB Webcam][] is enabled.  Pressing the camera button brings up the last picture taken in the race.

### Notes
The __Max Laps__, __Completing Lap__ and __Show Laps to Go__ are all with respect to the category doing the most laps in the race (fastest).  This is important for managing a race with one lap counter even if the different categories do a different number of laps.

Alternatively, you can manage the race with separate lap counters by category.  In this case, use the [Race Lap Chart](#race-lap-chart).

## Riders on Course

This display shows the total riders on course, a breakdown of the riders by category, and a count of which riders are on each lap.

## Race Lap Chart

This display shows graphically, by Category:

* the total number of laps in the race, and the laps to go
* the Category leader's number
* a Progress bar as showing where the leader is in the race
* a Timer counting down to when the leader is next expected
* the projected Finish Time of the race (finish line flag)
* the projected Expected Time of the last rider on course (broom)

Use this display to manage lap counters by category.  It allows you to easily see what lap each category is on, when to ring the bell, etc.
