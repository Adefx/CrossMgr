# Camera

CrossMgr can use a USB camera to take photos of riders as they cross the finish line.
This is especially effective when using an RFID reader.

CrossMgr will use the times taken by the RFID to take photos automatically.  A header is added to the photos with the rider's name and team, as well as the race time and time-of-day.  The photos are then stored with logical filenames making them easy to retrieve.

Photos are instantly accessible right from CrossMgr.  One convenient method is the Chart screen.  Laps with photos are shown with a camera icon.  Right-clicking on the bar allows you to bring up the picture.

## Test USB Camera...
