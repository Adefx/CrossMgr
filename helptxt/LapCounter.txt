# Lap Counter
Shows a lap counter for the race.

For best effect:

1. Create a separate __LapCounter__ screen from the __Windows__ menu.
1. Drag the __LapCounter__ screen to separate monitor.
1. Set up the monitor so the riders can see it.

The lap counter will flash before it is going to change.

If you are running the race by time, one lap counter is shown for the fastest category.

If you are running categories with specified __Race Laps__ (see [Categories][] for more details), a separate lap counter will be shown for each category.
