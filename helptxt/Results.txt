# Results
Results shows ranked riders in the race.  Riders are ranked first on distance covered (most laps), then by finish order (shortest time).

CrossMgr shows the finish time, gap and speed (if lap/race distances are configured in Categories).  If a rider has been lapped, the Gap column shows the number of laps down instead of the time gap.

There is a peculiar special case that can happen in multi-category races.  In a multi-category race, some riders may finish having been lapped by the leader of a faster category, but not lapped by their own category leader.

Although these riders has completed one less lap than their category leader, they technically are not lapped.  It is therefore impossible to compute a Gap time, nor is if fair to report those riders as down a lap.  In this case, CrossMgr simply shows nothing in the Gap column.

# Screen
The top of the screen contains controls.

The bottom is divided into two parts with an adjustable pane between them.  The left side shows data about the rider (finish order, Bib, name, team, license, finish time, speed, etc.).  The right side shows individual lap information.

Projected and auto-corrected entries suggested by CrossMgr are highlighed in yellow.  Manually edited times are shown in orange.  Highlights indicate that some adjustment has been made to the times that was not present in the originally collected data.  For more details about why/who/when, double-click on the entry and look at the entry details in RiderDetail.

# Controls
## Category
Selects the Category of the results.  Category "All" shows results as if all riders were in one category.  This is useful for comparing against manually generated results for the race as a whole.

## Show Rider Data
This toggles whether additional rider data are shown in Results.  If unset, riders' name, team, license, category etc. will not be shown.

## Lap Times
Shows the lap times.  Lap time are computed as the difference between the race times per lap.

## Race Times
Shows the race times per lap.

## Lap Speeds
Shows the speed by lap.  For this feature to work, the Lap Distance must be configured in Categories.

## Race Speeds
Shows the race speed up to that lap in the race.  This is useful to determine how long a race is expected to take.  For this feature to work, the Lap Distance must be configured in Categories.

## Search
Searches for the entered number and highlights it in the Results page.  This is a very useful feature when some asks "what happened to rider XXX?"

## Zoom In/Zoom Out
If you find the text to hard to read (perhaps you are in direct sunlight), or you want to see more information on the screen, you can change the text size by pressing the Zoom In or Zoom Out buttons.

# Additional Features

## Right-Click
Right-click brings up a number of options about what you clicked on:

Option|Action
:-----|:-----
History|Jumps to History tab with current rider highlighted
RiderDetail|Opens RiderDetail dialog for current rider
Correct...|Correct the current entry
Shift...|Shift current entry forward/backward in time
Delete...|Delete current entry
Swap with Rider Before|Swap current rider's finish time with preceeding rider's finish time
Swap with Rider After|Swap current rider's finish time with the following rider's finish time

Remember, Ctrl-Z is undo!

## Sort by Field
Clicking on any Field header column other than 'Bib', 'Pos', 'Gap', 'Time' or speed will sort by that column.  This allows you to sort by name, team, license, etc. as well as Start and Finish if running in time trial mode.

In time trial mode, it is critical to sort by 'Start' and 'Finish'.  This allows you to easily check manual results, especially by 'Finish', as this should match the finish order of a manual timer.

## Sort by Lap
Clicking on the Lap header column will sort the display by that lap, not the finish order.  Lap sort works with the data currently being displayed.  For example, if you are showing Lap Times, the shortest lap time will be sorted to the top.
In square brackets, the rank and bib number are also shown in the sorted column. 

This feature is very useful in the following cases determine the leader of a certain lap (for example, for a prem).  To do so, change the display to "Race Times", then click on the Lap column.  This will show you the current finish order of that lap.

This feature is also important when you need to restart a race after it was stopped, say, based on a course obstruction or weather delay (lightening).  By sorting the riders for the last lap, you can estimate the gaps between them for the restart.

## Fastest Lap Highlight
The Fastest Lap is always highlighted in green.  This calculation takes the lap distance (both first and subsequent) into account.
