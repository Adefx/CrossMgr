## Test USB Camera...
Opens a window that shows what the USB Camera is looking at.  Useful for positioning the USB camera on the finish line before a race.
The USB Camera cannot be tested while the race is running.

CrossMgr can use a USB camera to take photos of riders as they cross the finish line.
This is especially effective when using an RFID reader.

CrossMgr will use the timestamp provided by the RFID to take photos automatically.  A header is added to the photos with the rider's name and team, as well as the race time and time-of-day.  The photos are then stored with logical filenames making them easy to retrieve.

Photos are instantly accessible right from CrossMgr.  One convenient method is the Chart screen.  Laps with photos are shown with a camera icon.  Right-clicking on the bar allows you to bring up the picture.

Some technical wizardry solves the problem of latency.  Photos are synchronized and show the athletes as they cross the finish line.

## Simulate Race...

Runs a demo of CrossMgr based on automatically generated data.

Useful for exploring the capabilties of CrossMgr.  See [CrossMgrTutorial.doc.](https://www.sites.google.com/site/crossmgrsoftware/file-cabinet) for a detailed explanation about how to handle multiple categories, missed entries and disputes in the demo data.

## Change Race Start Time...
Allows you to change the Start Time of the race.  This is very useful if you start the race after the actual start time.  You can change the race start time before you enter times, while you are entering times, after you have entered all the times, or after you have finished the race.  Any times you have entered will be automatically adjusted based on the new race start time.

This is particularly convenient for a point-to-point race.  You don't need to have CrossMgr running when the race is started - just make a note of the time.  Then, at the finish, start a CrossMgr race and change the start time.

This is also convenient if you are busy starting a race and are away from CrossMgr.  Go ahead and start the race, then start CrossMgr, then change its Start Time.

You cannot change the start time of a Time Trial race.

## Copy Log File to Clipboard
Copies the last 1,000 lines of the CrossMgr log file to the clipboard.
The log can then be pasted into an email.

When reporting problems with CrossMgr, please include the log.
It contains important diagnostics to find the problem.

## Reload Checklist

Reloads the checklist file.  CrossMgr looks in three places for a "CrossMgrChecklist.txt" file:

1. The folder of the current Race
1. Your home folder
1. The CrossMgrImages folder in the install folder

See the "CrossMgrChecklist.txt" file for instructions on how to customize the checklist file.
