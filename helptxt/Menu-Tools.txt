## Change Race Start Time...
Allows you to change the Start Time of the race.  This is very useful if you start the race after the actual start time.  You can change the race start time before you enter times, while you are entering times, after you have entered all the times, or after you have finished the race.  Any times you have entered will be automatically adjusted based on the new race start time.

This is particularly convenient for a point-to-point race.  You don't need to have CrossMgr running when the race is started - just make a note of the time.  Then, at the finish, start a CrossMgr race and change the start time.

This is also convenient if you are busy starting a race and are away from CrossMgr.  Go ahead and start the race, then start CrossMgr, then change its Start Time.

You cannot change the start time of a Time Trial race.

## Copy Log File to Clipboard
Copies the last 1,000 lines of the CrossMgr log file to the clipboard.
The log can then be pasted into an email.

When reporting problems with CrossMgr, please include the log.
It contains important diagnostics to find the problem.
